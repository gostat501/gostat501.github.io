# "Go stat!"

I am a Decision Science Product Consultant at Disney Decision Science and Integration. I accelerate my company's business decision-making by providing data-driven solutions. My current projects are concentrated in the business fiealds of movie analytics, cooperate finance & accounting, and statistical literacy education - the topics for the data science related work includes time-sereis analysis, causal inference for marketing, machine learning, and advanced regression modeling. My undergraduate degree is a B.S. in Statistics and a Minor in Mathematics with summa cum laude at the University of California, Los Angeles (2019). During my undergraduate, I was a research assistant under the supervision of Prof.Frederic Paik Schoenberg, studying statistical and probability theories to handle time and sptatial data simultaneously (point-process), with its application to earthquake/crime/wild-fire studies.

My goal in the next 5 years is to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Statistics, specializing in causal inference with cyclical nature over time. The motivation behind this study is to demystify time varying "chicken-and-egg" dependencies between two nodes over time; one classic example is the substitue relationship between burgers and pizzas, where whenever the price of one goes up, as does the other after certain duration of time. Phenomenas analogous to this example is prevalent in the fields of businesses, economics, sociology, and biology, yet the exploration on the statistical framework of this study is remained inadequate. This topic potentially entails the study of: distribution shift, time-series analysis, network analysis, baysian inference, and game theory.
