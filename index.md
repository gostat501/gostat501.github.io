# Bio

I'm currently a Senior Decision Science Product Consultant at Disney's Decision Science and Integration team. In this role, I wear multiple hats acting as a product manager, data engineer, and data scientist to support business decision-making through data. My work sits at the intersection of finance and Disney's diverse business areas, including theme parks, media streaming, YouTube, and more.

I earned my B.S. in Statistics with a Minor in Mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2019, graduating summa cum laude. During my undergraduate years, I worked as a research assistant under Professor Frederic Paik Schoenberg, focusing on probability theory for spatio-temporal point processes.

Looking ahead, my goal over the next five years is to pursue a Ph.D. in Statistics with a focus on time-dynamic causal inference. I'm particularly interested in two interrelated areas that hold strong relevance in both industry and academia:

- Interdependencies Among Data Science Models: In large organizations, decisions driven by one model can subtly reshape the business landscape and thus, the data impacting other models in unforeseen ways. These ripple effects can be especially pronounced in companies with multiple lines of business. I'm interested in exploring how causal inference can help us understand and manage these hidden interdependencies. My long-term vision is to develop a set of philosophical "guardrails" for data science organizations to better account for such system-wide feedback loops.

- Causal Inference in Dynamic Networks: While causal inference has made strides in both time-series and network settings, real-world problems rarely fit neatly into just one of those categories. Many phenomena especially in observational settings combine temporal and network characteristics. This hybrid space remains underexplored despite its real-world significance. I hope to contribute to this emerging field, particularly with applications in computational social science and simulation-based modeling for understanding dynamics in society, economics, business, and politics.
